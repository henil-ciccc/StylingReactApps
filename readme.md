# Styling in React

_You are supposed to use Styled Components for all of these exercises._

## Questions:

1. Create a Styled Component for a simple 'Alert' box with a red background and white text. Implement it in a React component and display the alert box.

2. Build a Styled Component for a button that changes its background color when hovered. Additionally, make it reusable by allowing users to pass in different background colors as props.

3. You have a list of items in your React component, and you want to apply a Styled Component to every even-numbered item in the list with a different background color.

## Bonus:

1. Create a simple React app with 1-2 components and connect any third party library or framework of your choice. (Eg: Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI etc.)
